# OneDriveAPI
A disfunctional project to try and get better at python by creating some amount of centrialized storage on different devices

I forgot about the SDK so I'm just using requests which is kinda annoying but it's fine

# Usage
It kinda works, a little, just no interface and no multithreading or checks but you can manually run it and upload or download files

# Setup
So like you need a Azure Application and then make a config file with the tenant id, scopes, and client id. Also make a json file to store the cached Oauth token. Then install the depencies and run it, it pop up a window for microsoft login, then after you login answer the inputs and wait, maybe a while it's pretty bad
