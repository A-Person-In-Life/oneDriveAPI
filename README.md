# OneDriveAPI
A disfunctional project to try and get better at python by creating some amount of centrialized storage on different devices

I forgot about the SDK so I'm just using requests which is kinda annoying but it's fine

# Usage
It kinda works, a little, just no interface and no multithreading or checks but you can manually run it and upload or download files
